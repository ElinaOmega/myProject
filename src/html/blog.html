        This website is part of my tech class -course. The final project were
        you build your own website by using Html, CSS and Javascript. <br />
        Before the course I already knew some html and css and basics, like how
        to do a modest frontpage and style it. Javascript was quite new for
        me,<br />
        I had only seen my husband doing some exercise with it. <br />
        I had own my mind what I want my website looking like but the styling
        has change from the original one.<br />
        I like how it looks right now, of course in my mind it could be way
        better but Im glad that I could create soemthing like this with my
        little skills.
